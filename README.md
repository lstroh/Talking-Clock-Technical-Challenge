# Talking-Clock-Technical-Challenge

This is my solution for the Talking-Clock-Technical-Challenge.

HumanFriendlyTime is the module that provides the logic for the solution.
HumanFriendlyTimeTests is the unit test for HumanFriendlyTime.
obj1 is the main for objective 1.
obj2 is the main for objective 2.
For objective 3, I used FastAPI and uvicorn. I loaded the server with the command uvicorn obj3:app --reload after installing FastAPI and unicorn.
